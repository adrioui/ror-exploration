## Usage
### Employees
1. Index Endpoint

```bash
GET /api/v1/employees
```

Optional Parameters:
- page: The page number to retrieve (default is 1).
- per_page: The number of employees per page (default is 10).

Example Request:
```bash
GET /api/v1/employees?page=2&per_page=5
```

Example Response:
```json
{
  "employees": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "nik": "9710584542462636",
      "name": "Jamal Jamali",
      "gender": "female",
      "birth_place": "Tangerang",
      "birth_date": "2003-07-15",

  ],
  "meta": {
    "current_page": 2,
    "per_page": 5,
    "total_pages": 2,
    "total_count": 7
  }  
}
```
#### Explanation:
- The employees key contains an array of employee objects based on the requested page and per_page.
- The meta key provides pagination information:
    - current_page: The current page number (in this example, page 2).
    - per_page: The number of employees per page (in this example, 5).
    - total_pages: The total number of pages available (in this example, 2).
    - total_count: The total number of employees in the database (in this example, 7).

2. Show Endpoint
The "Show" endpoint is used to retrieve details of a specific employee by their ID. To use this endpoint, make a GET request to the following URL:
```bash
GET /api/v1/employees/:id
```

Example Request:
```bash
GET /api/v1/employees/1
```

Example Response (if the employee exists):
```json
{
